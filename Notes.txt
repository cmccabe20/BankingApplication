  theres an issue with the run command i tried to run the sample code and it auto added a new run command now it bugs out it was something in the shell tab cause I typed run TestTV.java and it said "not found" and added that command
  but it also messes with the banking application code when we run it as well now
idk how to delete that run command it installed

  ill look into it, maybe i'll move the sample codes to somewhere else
